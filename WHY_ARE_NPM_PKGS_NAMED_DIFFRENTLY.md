## Why are the npm pkgs on git under another name then the one on npm??

Well i have suffered the issue of having diffrent usernames for the platforms so the solution is that i let git follow its strict rules :D
i cannot fix it as ive been trying for a year now and this works and im not gonna bother trying another way.

#### The usernames

GH: `NeonGamerBot-QK`
npm: `neongamerbot`

the diff is in the `-QK` which is what is the major issue.
Thanks for understanding;
